# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling Project

In this project, we are interested to extract and analyze data from the WeRateDogs twitter feed based on comments, images, ratings, favorite and retweet counts.  

This project is divided in three parts: 
- Data Gathering 
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Analysis 
and presented under a jupyter notebook named wrangle_act.ipynb

The wrangling report summarizes the data quality and tidiness issues faced in this dataset after we gathered the data. 

The act report provides somes insights and visualizations after we cleaned the data.
