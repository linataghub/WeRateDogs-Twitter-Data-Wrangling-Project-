    "- Maybe due to a larger number of posts, puppers and doggos rating means tend to be lower than puppo and floofer\n",

    "- Based on the descriptive statistics available, we would say that Puppo and Floofer would have relatively better / stable ratings from the tweeter author with a ratio around 1.2 / 1.3. And maybe because these dog stages are less frequent on dog_rates, they have in average more favorite and retweet counts   \n"
